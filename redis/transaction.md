### Transaction

* All the commands in a transaction are serialized and executed sequentially. It can never happen that a request issued by another client is served in the middle of the execution of a Redis transaction. This guarantees that the commands are executed as a single isolated operation.
* Either all of the commands or none are processed, so a Redis transaction is also atomic. The EXEC command triggers the execution of all the commands in the transaction, so if a client loses the connection to the server in the context of a transaction before calling the EXEC command none of the operations are performed, instead if the EXEC command is called, all the operations are performed. 
* If the Redis server crashes or is killed by the system administrator in some hard way it is possible that only a partial number of operations are registered. Redis will detect this condition at restart, and will exit with an error. Using the redis-check-aof tool it is possible to fix the append only file that will remove the partial transaction so that the server can start again.
    ```
    > MULTI
    OK
    > INCR foo
    QUEUED
    > INCR bar
    QUEUED
    > EXEC
    1) (integer) 1
    2) (integer) 1
    ```
* Errors during transaction:
1. A command may fail to be queued, so there may be an error before EXEC is called.For instance the command may be syntactically wrong (wrong number of arguments, wrong command name, ...), or there may be some critical condition like an out of memory condition (if the server is configured to have a memory limit using the maxmemory directive).
1. A command may fail after EXEC is called, for instance since we performed an operation against a key with the wrong value (like calling a list operation against a string value).
* It's important to note that even when a command fails, all the other commands in the queue are processed â€“ Redis will not stop the processing of commands.

* Why Redis does not support roll backs?
  1. Redis commands can fail only if called with a wrong syntax (and the problem is not detectable during the command queueing), or against keys holding the wrong data type: this means that in practical terms a failing command is the result of a programming errors, and a kind of error that is very likely to be detected during development, and not in production.
  1. Redis is internally simplified and faster because it does not need the ability to roll back.
